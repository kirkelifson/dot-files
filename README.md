# Kirk Elifson's dot-files

# Warning:

### The installation script is very unforgiving. If you are not me it's wise to inspect the contents and take what you like.

# Full installation:

```
git clone https://github.com/kirkelifson/dot-files.git
cd dot-files
./install.sh
```

# Recommended:

* zsh 5.0.5
* vim 4.8 `--with-features=big`
* tmux 1.9a
* gdb 7.8
* git 2.3 (I would hope so)
