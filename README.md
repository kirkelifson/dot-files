#dot-files

This is my most committed repository which has both positive and negative sides. It suggests that I am interested in personalized development environments but also implies I am incredibly OCD (all true).

#### Be warned:

This includes my gitconfig and other preferences that are user specific. If you want to install everything then read the directions below. However it is also very simple to `cp` files that meet your standards. If I were you I would choose the latter. The installation script is very unforgiving.

#Usage

To install my exact environment execute the following commands:

```
git clone https://github.com/kirkelifson/dot-files.git
cd dot-files
./install
```

It's that simple.

#Required

For full installation and pleasure, you must have:

* zshell
* vim `--with-features=big`
* tmux
* gdb
* git (I would hope so)
